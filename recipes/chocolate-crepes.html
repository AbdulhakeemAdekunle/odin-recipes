    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      The mousse-like, chocolate filling for these crepes is made with chocolate
      pudding mix, instant coffee, and whipping cream. And to top it all off,
      it's drizzled with homemade chocolate sauce.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>6 teaspoons white sugar</li>
      <li>⅓ tablespoon butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1 fluid ounce cognac</li>
      <li>1 (3.9 ounce) package instant chocolate pudding mix</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon instant coffee granules</li>
      <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>4 (1 ounce) squares bittersweet chocolate</li>
      <li>½ cup butter or margarine</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups nonfat evaporated milk</li>
      <li>2 ½ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1: </strong> Crepe batter: in a large bowl, mix together
        eggs, milk, water, flour, sugar, 1 teaspoon butter, and cognac.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2: </strong> Filling: beat pudding mix, instant coffee and
        whipping cream together with an electric mixer until the mixture is
        thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3: </strong> Sauce: in a small saucepan, melt the
        chocolate, butter, evaporated milk, and confectioners' sugar together
        until the mixture is a little thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4: </strong> Crepes: heat a small skillet (or crepe pan) to
        a high temperature. Place a small amount of batter into the skillet and
        swirl it around until the batter covers the bottom of the pan. When the
        crepe is slightly browned flip the crepe over and let the other side
        brown for a few seconds. The first crepe will most likely not turn out
        well, but the rest will. Stack the crepes on top of each other to let
        tem cool before filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5: </strong>Spoon the filling into the center of each crepe
        and roll the crepe up around it. Spoon the sauce over the crepes and
        serve.
